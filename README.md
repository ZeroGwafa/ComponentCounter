# ComponentCounter

Install with this link (Alt1 Required): 

alt1://addapp/https://zerogwafa.github.io/ComponentCounter/appconfig.json

Tracks Invention materials from the following sources:
- Standard Dissassembling
- Auto-Dissassembler
- Spring Cleaner
- Scavenging

Keeps data until you hit the "Clear" button.

## Instructions:
    1. Open app with RuneScape window visible.

    2. Ensure that the chat filter is off.  This ensures that all component messages are visible.
    
    3. Start dissassembing items, or have a weapon/armor with Scavenging on it, or spring cleaner in inventroy, and slay some NPCs.

The app will automatically start tracking as soon as it is opened.

The table will auto-populate and keep track of the components that you have received.

Click "Stop" to stop tracking.

### Edit Mode

I have included an Edit mode, which will display all component rows, you can then edit the number of components for any row (in case you want to track all comps, including the ones you already have).  Uncheck the edit mode checkbox to save the changes.

Be sure to Click "Start" to once again track components, as it will be disabled while editing.


### Action Counter
- This will track how many times components were added to the list.  Good for tracking how many time Scavenging activated, or tracking how many objects you've dissassembled.

### Export to CSV
- Clicking this will generate a CSV file with your current component stats.
