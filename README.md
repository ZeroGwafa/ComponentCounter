Tracks Invention materials from the following sources:
- Standard Dissassembling
- Auto-Dissassembler
- Spring Cleaner
- Scavenging

Keeps data until you hit the "Clear" button.

## Instructions:
    1. Open app with RuneScape window visible.

    2. Ensure that the chat filter is off.  This ensures that all component messages are visible.
    
    3. Start dissassembing items, or have a weapon/armor with Scavenging on it, or spring cleaner in inventroy, and slay some NPCs.

The app will automatically start tracking as soon as it is opened.

The table will auto-populate and keep track of the components that you have received.

Click "Stop" to stop tracking.

### Action Counter
- This will track how many times components were added to the list.  Good for tracking how many time Scavenging activated, or tracking how many objects you've dissassembled.

### Export to CSV
- Clicking this will generate a CSV file with your current component stats.  

### Chat Selector
- Useful if you want the app to target a specific window.
